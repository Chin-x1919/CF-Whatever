# What is this?

CF-Package is a bundle of tools used in the CF-Whatever™ base system.
It’s not meant to be useful. It’s meant to exist beautifully.

Think of this like /usr/local/bin that got out of hand.

## What these tools do

| Tool        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **cfmenu**  | A cursed text menu for basic system navigation. Basically your BIOS but worse. |
| **cupctl**  | A command-line utility to “fill your cup.” Does nothing useful, but it’s hilarious. |
| **flashlight** | A terminal-based “searchlight” utility for locating files in the system (also probably useless). |

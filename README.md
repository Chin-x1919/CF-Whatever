# Welcome to **CF-Whatever™**

This is a **base system** from the **CF-SPACE™** series — proudly forked from **FreeBSD**.  
Nobody asked for it, but it exists anyway™

## What is CF-Whatever?

**CF-Whatever** is the experimental core of the CF-Space ecosystem.  
It’s the weird cousin of FreeBSD — built for fun, chaos, and curiosity.

- Based on **FreeBSD Kernel & Userland**  
- Motto: *“BSD, but cursed — and CF-branded.”*  
- This repository only contains **CF-Packages**, not the full OS.

> TL;DR:  
> **CF-Whatever** = experimental meme build  
> **CF-OS** = daily-use build (user-friendly version)

## Included Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **CF-Menu™** | A cursed text-menu system for basic navigation. BIOS energy, but worse. |
| **Cupctl™** | A command-line tool to "fill your cup" — completely useless, absolutely essential. |
| **Flashlight™** | A terminal-based search utility that probably finds nothing, but tries anyway. |

This is a **based system** for the CF-SPACE™ series project, proudly forked from **FreeBSD**  
Nobody asked for it, but it exists anyway.™

## What is CF-Whatever?
CF-Whatever is the **base OS layer** of CF-Space projects:
- Built on top of **FreeBSD Kernel & Userland**
- Modified with **CF-Vibe™**
- Motto: *"BSD but cursed, and CF-branded."*

Think of it as the unstable cousin of FreeBSD —  
**CF-Whatever = experimental meme build**  
**CF-OS = daily-use build (user-friendly)**
